# Overview

Mobile Apps are very important and prominant part of our technology. I want to learn these important skills for the future and this was my first dive into making mobile apps. I would love to continue working on these.

The app is the start of an ecommerce app and is just two screens. You can switch between the two screens, one is the opening screen and you can navigate to the second page. The second page is the start of ecommerce card. It shows picture a of furniture and lets you like it or dislike it.


This app would be used to show new furniture and they can like it and dislike it In the future, it would allow them to figure out if they want to buy.
